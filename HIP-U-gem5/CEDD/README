Canny Edge Detection - data partitioning (CEDD)

Compilation instructions:

    make

Execution instructions

    ./cedd

For more options:

    ./cedd -h


Note:
The input folder contains frames from a sample video. In order to generate frames 
with a format suitable for this benchmark, use convert_frames in utils folder.
The output folder contains output frames for comparison purposes. In order to 
generate output frames, use ced_output_frames in utils folder.
